## What is TreoCRM?
TreoCRM is an open-source CRM System, which is based on TreoCore Software platform and is developed by TreoLabs GmbH. TreoCRM is distributed under GPLv3 License and is free. TreoCRM is a true alternative to such open source CRM systems as SugarCRM, SuiteCRM, OroCRM or Vtiger.

TreoCRM is a single page application (SPA) with an API-centric, service-oriented architecture and flexible data model based on configurable entities and relations. In TreoCRM you can organize any data and business processes in terms of CRM and outside of its scope, if needed.

TreoCRM is a fork of EspoCRM, which comes with more advanced features and is more flexible for extensive software development. The main differences to EspoCRM are: 
* more flexible core 
* more advanced filters on list views
* module manager based on composer technology
* anchor navigation on all detail views
* UI optimized for smartphones and tablets
* configurable two-level navigation
* colored enum and multi-enum field types
* existence of owners for entity exemplars
* and more...

Please consider, TreoCRM will not be compatible with EspoCRM. EspoCRM modules can still be used with TreoCRM, but only after some modifications in code.

### For whom?
